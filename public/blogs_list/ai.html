    <p> 1. <span class="underline"> Introduction </span> </p>
    <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines as opposed to natural 
        intelligence demonstrated by animals, such as humans. Artificial intelligence was established as 
        a field of study in 1956. Since its inception, AI research has tried and rejected a variety of 
        approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, 
        large knowledge databases, and imitating animal behavior. Machine learning with a high 
        mathematical-statistical component dominated the field in the first decades of the twenty-first 
        century, and this technique has proven to be extremely successful in solving a variety of difficult 
        problems.

    <p> 2. <span class="underline"> Advances and Impact of AI to the Society </span> </p>
    <p> As the successful of AI, these are some stunning advances in artificial intelligence.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold"> Profound AI </span> - Profound AI is a cancer-detection program that helps radiologists uncover early 
                digital breast tom synthesis (DBT) in patients. The technology has only been tested in a few 
                high-profile hospitals so far, but it's a promising sign of what's to come in the future.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold"> AI artwork </span> - The first piece of AI-generated artwork sold at a global auction for more than 
                $432,500 in October 2018. It was created by a Paris-based collective that studies the 
                intersection of AI and art.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold"> AI generated human faces </span> - Japanese startup Data Grid has created a series of photorealistic 
                images of what appear to be human faces. This advance utilizes a whole new level of deep 
                learning algorithms that create realistic images.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold"> Autonomous driving </span> - The Audi SQ5 was equipped with autonomous driving technology and 
                software from Delphi Technologies. In 2015 the first cross-country road trip performed by an 
                autonomous car was completed in nine days. Though the safety driver (seated in the front seat 
                per the law) reportedly had to interfere a few times, the trip marked a huge advancement in 
                the future of driverless car technology.</li>
            <li><span class="bold"> Siri </span> - Although Siri is now found in most modern Apple products, the automated voice 
                assistant technology was cutting-edge when it first became commercially available in 2010. Siri 
                caught Steve Jobs' attention after it was released as an app, and he bought the technology for 
                $200 million.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> 3. <span class="underline"> Ethical Questions that raised by AI </span> </p>
    <p> Due to the fast growth of AI technology, a lot of ethical questions have been raised. Cyber 
        security is one of them. As artificial intelligence (AI) develops more powerful in our society, it 
        will become increasingly deadly as a weapon. It is like a bad actor may take control of the AI 
        that manages a city's water supply, electricity system, or traffic signals. The militarization of AI, 
        in which robots learn to fight and drones can fly themselves into conflict, is much scarier. 
        Controlling who has access to AI's capabilities is a significant challenge and a fine line to walk.
        Another problem of AI is wealth inequality. The companies who are spending the most on AI 
        development today are companies that have a lot of money to spend. A major ethical concern 
        is AI will only serve to centralize wealth further. Machines will create wealth more than ever in 
        the economy of the future. Governments and corporations should start thinking now about 
        how we redistribute that wealth.
    </p>

    <p> 4. <span class="underline"> Future of AI </span> </p>
    <p> When talking about the future of health care industries, AI has the ability to provide the facility 
        to detect disease based on symptoms; even if you don't go to a doctor, AI would read the data 
        from Fitness band/medical history of an individual to analyze the pattern and suggest proper 
        medication and even deliver it on one's fingertips just through cell-phone. Doctors have already 
        been beaten by Google's deep mind in diagnosing fatal diseases like breast cancer. It won't be 
        long before AI can recognize common diseases and make appropriate treatment 
        recommendations.
        In the future, artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionize education. Manufacturing industries no 
        longer require skilled laborers, as robots and technology have mostly replaced them. The 
        educational system has the potential to be very effective and tailored to the individual's 
        personality and abilities. It would provide opportunities for brighter pupils to shine, as well as a 
        better opportunity for imbeciles to cop up.
    </p>

    <p> 5. <span class="underline"> Conclusion </span> </p>
    <p> In conclusion, we can say that AI will become more valuable to humans than its capabilities. 
        Some people are concerned about the creation of a robot that can self-learn and develop skills. 
        Artificial intelligence will surpass humans in terms of IQ and will outperform humans in a variety 
        of talents and expertise. Humans will continue to discover new things and produce new 
        discoveries. The future is unknown, but it is possible that artificial intelligence and humans may 
        be able to collaborate on a variety of issues.
