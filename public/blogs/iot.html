    <p class="heading"> Internet of Things and its Cyber Security Implications </p>
    <p> 1. <span class="underline"> Introduction </span> </p>
    <p> The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to physical objects that are equipped with sensors, 
        processing ability, software, and other technologies. Devices do not need to be connected to 
        the public internet; instead, they must be connected to a network.
        The first ARPANET-connected device was a Coca-Cola vending machine, which became the first 
        Internet of Things (IOT) in 1982. Reza Raji defined the concept in 1994 as sending little data 
        packets to a large number of nodes in order to integrate and automate everything from home 
        appliances to huge industries. In 1999, Bill Joy presented his "Six Webs" concept at Davos, 
        which included device-to-device communication.
        IoT technology is most closely associated with items related to the concept of the "smart 
        home" in the consumer market. Devices and appliances that support one or more common 
        ecosystems and can be operated through ecosystem-related devices like smartphones and 
        smart speakers. Because of the confluence of numerous technologies, such as ubiquitous 
        computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine 
        learning, the field has progressed.
    </p>

    <p> 2. <span class="underline"> Difference between IoT and Traditional Internet </span> </p>
    <p> The primary distinction between the IoT and the traditional internet is the identity of the 
        content creator. In traditional internet, the content is created by humans, while in IoT it is 
        done by machines. However, there are several other differences between them.
        In the Internet of Things (IoT), data is consumed by pushing technology as a notification or 
        triggering an action when a situation of interest is detected. In the traditional Internet, one has 
        to ask a query, issue a search or send a request for a web service in order to consume the 
        content. Physical links between web pages are used to connect users on the traditional 
        Internet. For situation detection in the Internet of Things, a combination of data is necessary. 
        This is reflected in context-based event patterns, in which some data determines the context 
        while others decide the pattern itself.
    </p>

    <p> 3. <span class="underline"> Challenges for Cyber Security and How To Resolve </span> </p>
    <p> As the growth of IoT, there are few challenges it creates for cyber security. IoT Security Data 
        encryption, IoT Security Data Authentication, IoT Security Side Channel Attack, Hijacking of IoT 
        Devices and Ransom-war are some of them. Now let's briefly discuss some examples.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold"> IoT Security Data Encryption </span> - To safeguard users' privacy, Internet of Things (IoT) apps 
                store and handle a vast quantity of data, which must be secured. When data is 
                transmitted wirelessly, encryption is frequently required, which means personal 
                information such as whereabouts can only be accessed by the person in question. 
                Consumer data is now encrypted and secured on the internet using the Secure Sockets 
                Layer (SSL) protocol.
            </li>
            <li><span class="bold"> IoT Security Data Authentication </span> - There is always a chance that the system will be 
                compromised after effective data encryption. If there is no mechanism to check the 
                accuracy of data transported to and from an IoT computer, security is threatened. Even 
                if the data is encrypted, someone could make up false data and transmit it to the 
                sensor, instructing it to cool the room despite the fact that it is already cold.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Here are some of the solutions to these.
        <ul>
            <li> Protect the confidential files from unauthorized entry. </li>
            <li> Put an end to all efforts to take control of IoT devices and install malware. </li>
            <li> Fully isolate the IoT system from the outside world, protecting protected info. </li>
            <li> Make sure the IoT device is up to date on a regular basis. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> 4. <span class="underline"> Future of IoT </span> </p>
    <p> In the near future, we can see smart homes, smart cities, industrial IoT, healthcare IoT etc. 
        According to ABI Research, the smart home industry is predicted to grow to $317.6 billion by 
        2026. Here are some of the most important smart home trends for the coming decade. The 
        majority of these features are now available, and more are on the way.
        <ul>
            <li> Smart homes for improving health. </li>
            <li> Greener operation. </li>
            <li> The cooperative home. </li>
            <li> Working from home. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> 5. <span class="underline"> Conclusion </span> </p>
    <p> The Internet of Things (IoT) requires a high level of security to ensure data privacy and integrity, 
        as well as to deal with threats and concerns as they arise. Insufficient security in IoT systems 
        can lead to device failures, financial losses, and even system annihilation. Having protection 
        enabled by default guarantees that features are calibrated to their most secure configurations 
        at all times, including before, during, and after production.
